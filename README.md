# Inteligent-Sistems
Projects and documentation done in IS in Bachelor's Degree with my partner David Dag Mora Zapata. 

There are 3 major areas of projects:

- [Embodied reactive agents:](https://github.com/MihaiLupoiu/Inteligent-Sistems/blob/master/Trabajos/Embodied%20reactive%20agents.pdf)

Abstract -- In this article we are going to explain the basic study about Embodied and Reactive Agents, as well as explaining the different types of tests we’ve done with the robot Lego Mindstorm NXT. The tests were made in do environments, physical and virtual.

- [Genetic Algorithms:](https://github.com/MihaiLupoiu/Inteligent-Sistems/blob/master/Trabajos/Genetic%20Algorithms.pdf)

Abstract -- In this article we are going to do a study on Genetic Algorithms, and how we can resolve problems really complex using the Pyevolve extra package of Python. We will also see diferent tipes problems and se how we can resolve them. 

- [Neuronal Network:](https://github.com/MihaiLupoiu/Inteligent-Sistems/blob/master/Trabajos/Neuronal%20Network.pdf)

Abstract -- In this article we are going to do a study on neural networks, and how we can create artificial neural networks by using the “PyBrain” modul of Python. We will also explain how to use that module and how we can train the artificial neural network so we can achieve the desired results.
